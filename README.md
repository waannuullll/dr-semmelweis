This project will discuss one of the events experienced by Dr. Semmelweis in 1840 when 10% of all maternal deaths in Vienna General Hospital were due to childbed fever. The raw data used were taken from Semmelweis publications. From the two clinics that were compared, where one clinic was managed by medical students who also handled corpses in the autopsy room and the other clinic was taken care of by other volunteers, it was found that the deaths of mothers who gave birth were mostly found in clinics that were managed by medical students. At that time the bacteria were not known, therefore from this incident Dr. Semmelweis advises everyone to wash their hands before helping the birth process. By washing hands, the ratio of maternal mortality to child birth decreases dramatically, namely around 6.7 - 10%, using Bootstrap analysis.
